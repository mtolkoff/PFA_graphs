# PFA_graphs
A sample of the algorithms I used to generate the figures in my thesis, Phylogenetic Factor Analysis and Natural Extensions

# Usage
Downlaod and install BEAST from http://beast.community/installing. Load BEAST and run the XML file. Then run the corresponding graph program through R which will produce the corresponding output file. If you are interested in the full MCMC output, I recommend using the program Tracer to look at the full results.

# Aquilegia Flowers
Also known as columbine flowers. The open question is what characteristics are associated with pollinator type. To read this graph, green is positively associated with green within a row, and negatively associated with purple. Similarly, purple is positively associated with purple circles. Unshaded circles reflect discrete data, where circle size is less meaningful scientifically. Each row represents a different evolutionary process.
